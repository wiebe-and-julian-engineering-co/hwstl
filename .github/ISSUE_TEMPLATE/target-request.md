## Target Architecture
Describe what the target architecture is, e.g. SAM3X8E, LPC4078. Also briefly describe how complex the suggested architecture is.

## Development Boards
Provide a couple of links to existing development boards using the specified architecture.

## References
Include references to datasheets, instruction set references and general architecture references. For example the datasheet for the SAM3X8E does not include information about the Cortex M3 architecture. Have them accessible with as little clicks as possible.
